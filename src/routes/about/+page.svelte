    Thomas is living an adventure as the Information Security Architect for the Yukon Territorial Government. He is also an incoming MS Cybersecurity student and Cyberfellow at the NYU Tandon School of engineering.
    <br />
    Born and raised in Edmonton, Thomas is the second child of refugee parents. His parents came to Canada following the Vietnam war as part of the many boat people Canada welcomed. Much of his work around anti-racism and helping racialized communities flourish is guided by his family history. The hard work and dedication his parents brought with them is something he strives to honour every single day.
    <br />
    Prior to entering politics, Thomas pursued a BSc. Computing Science Hon. at the University of Alberta. He worked as a software developer at various startups and was an activist and advocate for social policy. In 2022, he completed a BSc. Cybersecurity and Information Assurance from Western Governors University. He has also completed a University Certificate in Computing and Information Systems from Athabasca University.
    <br />
    Thomas holds a number of technical certifications. He has the ISACA CISM, OSEP, OSCP, CCSK, A+, Network+, Security+, CySA+, and ITIL v4 Foundations certifications.

    When not at work, Thomas enjoys playing with his cats Fluffles, Zuri, and Peaches, hiking or running, or taking cheesy food photos on instagram. If he’s out hiking, kayaking, or hot spring hunting, you’ll probably need to look somewhere without cell service.
